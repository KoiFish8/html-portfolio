<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>School</h2>
<p>
  I am a 7th grader at Ellen Fletcher Middle School. I'm taking Spanish 1A and IT 1B as my electives and is taking 8th grade math (algebra 1). Next year, I will be taking Spanish 1B
  and Orchestra as my electives and will be doing 9th grade geometry. I have (so far) all A's in all classes except for english.

<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
<p>
  I have multiple extracurriculars with multiple amounts of homework. I am doing 2 art classes every week, one for independant work and one for group work. I am taking the geometry 
  course in AOPS academy, and will soon be taking Algbra 2 and maybe Physics. I am in house league hockey in the San Jose Sharks Ice Rink and our team, the Predators, are currently 
  in 3rd place out of 4, and will be climbing up in the ranks for hopefully 2nd since we have lost the chance for first. I used to do private viola lessons, but now I am merely 
  practicing for the next year of school. I am also doing C++ and Python lessons from IDtech private lessons.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
